# Architecture

### Foundation

After asking for feedback from the various mentors involved in the development of the application, it has been suggested to use HCP, CRM/C4C or Successfactors as a foundation for the application. In SAP Jam the pro's and con's have been gathered, which have been discussed in a phone conference. Looking at features only, a custom solutions and a solution based on CRM ended up equally high. Eventually factors as availability of license and dependencies with additional system components have led to the decision to build a custom solution. The team has found sponsorship from SAP's executives to sponsor a HANA Cloud Platform account to go ahead with the solution.
